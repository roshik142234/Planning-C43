Story: A famous explorer that was known all over the owrld for his work wanted something to do. While looking into a magazine, he saw and article written about a Aztec Temple that protected an ancient artifact. He wanted to put that artifact into a museum. He set out for the temple. Soon after arriving it, he was greeted by a sign from somebody else. It told him that inside the temple was many many booby traps and enemies waiting for him. He decided to go in, ignoring the sign.

Characters: There will be only 1 PC player. That is the temple explorer. The NPC's will be zombies and the final boss.

Game: The game will be about doging obstacles such as lava pit, pressure plates, and zombies. To progress through the game, you must make it to the door at the end of the level. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. Certain variables such as zombie speed, amount of obstacles, and harder jumps. there will be an animation for jumping, sliding, and walking. I got this idea from frieboy and watergirl, along with OwO.
